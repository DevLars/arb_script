------------- setup -------------
connect to API's
get order books (get request limits?)
act when sell diffrence is above threshold
buy (BTC - NEO) from low exchange, sell (NEO-BTC) from high exchange
Intermediar is ETH or USDT, both pairs on 6/7 exchanges

Why NEO?
Cheap/no fees, lot of eth/usdt pairs, fast




Notes
#Query call different signature kucoin and binance, based on id or type
#When deleting order, query orders to check if it is deleted
